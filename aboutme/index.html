    <p>Hi everyone!!! It’s a pleasure to know each one of you.</p> 
    <p>I’m from Cotia, São Paulo, Brazil. I like to read, do radical sports, listen to podcasts, stay with my family and friends, and travel.</p>
    <p>I work in a Cultural Organization dealing with the pedagogical area. It’s very strange that someone from the humanities field goes to the technology area, hahaha, but I intend to migrate because the technology is there, and we need to follow.</p>
    <p>My favorite quote is from Sister Hinckley: “The only way to face life is to laugh. You can laugh or cry when faced with problems. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache.”
    <p>It will be an adventure to embark on this world of programming with you.
